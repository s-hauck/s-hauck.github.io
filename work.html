          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>
            Spotify gives users exactly what they want... almost to a fault. The
            current algorithm primarily focuses on recommending music to users
            that they already know and like, rather than introducing them to new
            and exciting music. Spotify algorithms also ignore genres that users
            enjoy but don’t often explore, this prevents users from discovering
            fresh tracks from their broader taste. In interviews, users
            expressed dissatisfaction with Spotify's recommendations, while they
            appreciate the how the Spotify algorithm curates content in a way
            which maintains a certain vibe, users voiced a desire for more
            variety beyond their usual preferences.
          </p>
          <h4>Key Assumptions</h4>

          <p>
            1. Users want to store their favorite artists in one place while
            discovering new music based on their tastes.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. The current algorithm limits users, preventing them from stepping
            outside their usual music bubble.
          </p>

          <h4>Outcome</h4>

          <p>
            One of the key design suggestions which I recommend is the
            introduction of a “Manage Algorithm” setting. This feature would
            allow users to customize their scope of recommendations which
            Spotify provides, giving users more control over their listening
            experience. The goal is to offer users the ability to adjust the
            algorithm’s reach, allowing users to explore music from genres they
            like but may not actively seek out, and beyond.
          </p>

          <h4>Interviews Conducted</h4>

          <p>Three Spotify users were interviewed.</p>

          <h4>User Pain Points</h4>

          <p>
            A common frustration voiced by users was that the algorithm has a
            tendency to recycle songs or deliver unsatisfactory recommendations.
            Many disliked the changes to how songs are added to the "Liked
            Songs" playlist, feeling it adds unnecessary steps. One interviewee
            voiced strong disapproval of Spotify's pre-curated playlists, which
            often they found duplicates their current favourite songs instead of
            introducing new music. Because of this, users opt to listen to
            user-generated playlists instead.
          </p>

          <h4>Engagement</h4>
          <p>
            Features like Spotify Wrapped and other engagement tools were viewed
            positively, enhancing the overall user experience. Interviewees
            expressed a desire for more human input in music recommendations,
            favoring personal curation, like playlists from friends, over
            algorithmic suggestions.
          </p>

          <h4>New Music vs. Variety</h4>
          <p>
            The algorithm tends to prioritize new music within the user’s
            current tastes, rather than offering diverse recommendations based
            on their past listening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users feel they aren't being introduced to truly new music, even
            though the suggestions align with their preferences. There is also a
            desire for variety across genres, not just new tracks within a
            specific genre. While some users appreciate personalized playlists
            like the Daily Mix or Discover Weekly, others reject them entirely.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most users find algorithms useful for discovering new music, though
            success rates vary, and many prefer to discover music outside the
            platform, such as in social settings or through friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smart Shuffle is a microcosm for how Spotify recommends music. As a
            brief experiment, interviewees were asked to choose a random
            playlist that they had created, then press play with smart shuffle
            enabled. Interviewees were then asked to consider the first 11 songs
            added by smart shuffle.
          </p>
          <p>How many unique artists are there?</p>
          <p>How many of the artists do you know?</p>
          <p>Of the 11 added songs, how many do you know?</p>
          <h4>This was the results from this test:</h4>
          <div class="list">
            <ul>
              <h4>Interviewee 1</h4>
              <li>11 songs made by 5 artists.</li>
              <li>They knew 8 of 11 songs.</li>
              <li>They knew 4 of 5 artists. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <h4>Interviewee 2</h4>
              <li>11 songs made by 6 artists.</li>
              <li>They knew 6 of 11 songs.</li>
              <li>They knew 6 of 6 artists. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <h4>Interviewee 3</h4>
              <li>11 songs made by 9 artists.</li>
              <li>They knew 8 of 11 songs.</li>
              <li>hey knew 6 of 9 artists.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>
            Spotify’s recommendations seem to fall between two primary
            parameters: relevance (vibe, genre, artist) and familiarity. All
            interviewees have different music habits, but they are recommended
            music that is mostly familiar, at similar rates. This means that
            Spotify tends to emphasize music users already know, recommending
            less entirely “new” or “different” music. While this isn't
            inherently bad, as users may prefer the comfort of familiar music,
            it creates a potential issue: the algorithm may trap users in a
            feedback loop. They may not even realize they’re stuck or know how
            to break free and discover fresh, exciting music.
          </p>
          <h4>New Assumption</h4>
          <p>
            Because Spotify effectively delivers music users like, many users
            are less inclined to actively search for new music. Instead, they
            rely on the platform’s recommendations, which reinforces the
            feedback loop and keeps them within their musical ecosystem.
          </p>

          <h4>Design Solution</h4>
          <p>
            The “Manage Algorithm” setting would work with three parameters:
            Newness, Variety, and Proximity. (These labels should be user-tested
            to ensure they are clear and intuitive.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Manage Algorithm Design Statement Enhance Spotify's music discovery
            features by addressing frustrations with the algorithm's narrow
            focus. Improve the balance between personalized recommendations and
            exposure to new, diverse music. This can be achieved by refining
            Spotify’s algorithms, adjusting features, and promoting more
            community-driven content, ultimately improving user satisfaction.
          </p>
          <h4>Design Principles and Recommendations</h4>
          <p>
            Encourage Discovery: Offer more variety in recommendations. One of
            the best feelings when discovering new music is thinking, "I never
            thought I’d like this," which stems from novelty. The algorithm
            should strive to provide this type of experience.
          </p>

          <h4>Manage Algorithm Setting</h4>
          <p>
            Develop a new setting that allows users to customize the scope of
            their recommendations, enabling users to tailor their music feed to
            suit their preferences. The "Manage Algorithm" setting should align
            with the rest of Spotify’s settings, keeping the interface simple
            and intuitive. Given the concept's complexity, the design must be
            easy for users to understand and use. A visualizer will be essential
            to provide immediate feedback beyond just percentages. I propose a
            pill-shaped interface with three components: two orbs (green and
            purple) and an outline.
          </p>
          <h4>1. Green (Newness):</h4>
          <p>
            This controls how much new music a listener will hear. It adjusts
            the percentage of new songs versus familiar ones, particularly in
            situations like radio play or smart shuffle. The more users
            increases "newness," the more unfamiliar (new) music users will hear
            within their chosen vibe.
          </p>
          <h4>2. Purple (Variety):</h4>
          <p>
            This controls the variety of music a listener will hear. Spotify's
            current algorithm tends to restrict recommendations to genres that
            fit the user’s taste profile, leaving out genres they may also
            enjoy. The Variety parameter would allow users to expand (or narrow)
            their musical diet by adding or subtracting genres.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Outline (Proximity):</h4>
          <p>
            This parameter controls how close the recommendations stay to a
            user’s taste profile. Think of it as casting a net, but with
            adjustable size. The Proximity setting determines how far the
            algorithm will reach into different musical territories to provide
            suggestions, allowing users to explore music outside their usual
            preferences.
          </p>

          <h4>Wrap it up</h4>
          <p>
            By integrating these three components, the “Manage Algorithm”
            feature empowers users to take control of their music discovery
            experience and break free from repetitive and restricting
            recommendations.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is fully within my knowledge that Spotify would never do this...
            but a feature such as this would be a first of its kind and would
            result in a content experience like no other.
