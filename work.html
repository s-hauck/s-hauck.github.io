          <h3>Problem</h3>

          <div class="card">
            <p>
              Spotify gives users exactly what they want... almost to a fault.
              Spotify's algorithms focus on recommending music that users
              already know and like, rather than introducing them to new and
              exciting tracks. The platform also tends to overlook genres that
              users enjoy but don't often explore, limiting their ability to
              discover fresh tracks within their broader taste. In interviews,
              users expressed dissatisfaction with Spotify’s recommendations.
              While they appreciate how Spotify curates music to maintain a
              consistent vibe, many voiced a desire for more variety beyond
              their usual preferences.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Key Assumptions</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              1. Users want to store their favorite artists in one place while
              discovering new music based on their tastes.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. The current algorithm limits users, preventing them from
              stepping outside their usual music bubble.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              One of the key design suggestions which I recommend is the
              introduction of a “Manage Algorithm” setting. This feature would
              allow users to customize their scope of recommendations which
              Spotify provides, giving users more control over their listening
              experience. The goal is to offer users the ability to adjust the
              algorithm’s reach, allowing users to explore music from genres
              they like but may not actively seek out, and beyond.

          <h3>Interviews Conducted</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>Three Spotify users were interviewed.</p>
          </div>
          <h3>User Pain Points</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              A common frustration voiced by users was that the algorithm has a
              tendency to recycle songs or deliver unsatisfactory
              recommendations. Many disliked the changes to how songs are added
              to the "Liked Songs" playlist, feeling it adds unnecessary steps.
              One interviewee voiced strong disapproval of Spotify's pre-curated
              playlists, which often they found duplicates their current
              favourite songs instead of introducing new music. Because of this,
              users opt to listen to user-generated playlists instead.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Engagement</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              Features like Spotify Wrapped and other engagement tools were
              viewed positively, enhancing the overall user experience.
              Interviewees expressed a desire for more human input in music
              recommendations, favoring personal curation, like playlists from
              friends, over algorithmic suggestions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>New Music vs. Variety</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              The algorithm tends to prioritize new music within the user’s
              current tastes, rather than offering diverse recommendations based
              on their past listening.
            </p>

            <p>
              Users feel they aren't being introduced to truly new music, even
              though the suggestions align with their preferences. There is also
              a desire for variety across genres, not just new tracks within a
              specific genre. While some users appreciate personalized playlists
              like the Daily Mix or Discover Weekly, others reject them
              entirely.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most users find algorithms useful for discovering new music,
              though success rates vary, and many prefer to discover music
              outside the platform, such as in social settings or through
              friends.

          <div class="card">
            <p>
              Smart Shuffle is a microcosm for how Spotify recommends music. As
              a brief experiment, interviewees were asked to choose a random
              playlist that they had created, then press play with smart shuffle
              enabled. Interviewees were then asked to consider the first 11
              songs added by smart shuffle.

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              Spotify’s recommendations seem to fall between two primary
              parameters: relevance to vibe, genre, artist and familiarity to
              user. All interviewees have different music habits, but are all
              recommended music that is mostly familiar, at similar rates. This
              means that Spotify tends to emphasize music users already know,
              recommending less entirely “new” or “different” music. While this
              isn't inherently bad, as users may prefer the comfort of familiar
              music, but there is a potential issue: the algorithm may trap
              users in a feedback loop. They may not even realize they’re stuck
              or know how to break free and discover fresh, exciting music.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>New Assumption</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              Because Spotify effectively delivers music that users like, many
              users are less inclined to actively search for new music. Instead,
              they rely on the platform’s recommendations, which reinforces the
              feedback loop and keeps users within their musical ecosystem.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Design Principles and Recommendations</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              Encourage Discovery: Offer more variety in recommendations. One of
              the best feelings when discovering new music is thinking, "I never
              thought I’d like this," which stems from novelty. The algorithm
              should strive to provide this type of experience.

          </div>
          <h3>Design Solution</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              The “Manage Algorithm” setting would work with three parameters:
              Newness, Variety, and Proximity. (These labels should be
              user-tested to ensure they are clear and intuitive.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Manage Algorithm Design Statement Enhance Spotify's music
              discovery features by addressing frustrations with the algorithm's
              narrow focus. Improve the balance between personalized
              recommendations and exposure to new, diverse music. This can be
              achieved by refining Spotify’s algorithms, adjusting features, and
              promoting more community-driven content, ultimately improving user
              satisfaction.

          <h3>Manage Algorithm Setting</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              Develop a new setting that allows users to customize the scope of
              their recommendations, enabling users to tailor their music feed
              to suit their preferences. The "Manage Algorithm" setting should
              align with the rest of Spotify’s settings, keeping the interface
              simple and intuitive. Given the concept's complexity, the design
              must be easy for users to understand and use. A visualizer will be
              essential to provide immediate feedback beyond just percentages. I
              propose a pill-shaped interface with three components: two orbs
              (green and purple) and an outline.
            </p>
          </div>

          <img

            class="image1"
          />

          <h3>1. Green (Newness)</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              This controls how much new music a listener will hear. It adjusts
              the percentage of new songs versus familiar ones, particularly in
              situations like radio play or smart shuffle. The more users
              increases "newness," the more unfamiliar (new) music users will
              hear within their chosen vibe.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>2. Purple (Variety)</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              This controls the variety of music a listener will hear. Spotify's
              current algorithm tends to restrict recommendations to genres that
              fit the user’s taste profile, leaving out genres they may also
              enjoy. The Variety parameter would allow users to expand (or
              narrow) their musical diet by adding or subtracting genres.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>3. Outline (Proximity)</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              This parameter controls how close the recommendations stay to a
              user’s taste profile. Think of it as casting a net, but with
              adjustable size. The Proximity setting determines how far the
              algorithm will reach into different musical territories to provide
              suggestions, allowing users to explore music outside their usual
              preferences.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Wrap it up</h3>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              By integrating these three components, the “Manage Algorithm”
              feature empowers users to take control of their music discovery
              experience and break free from repetitive and restricting
              recommendations.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is fully within my knowledge that Spotify would never do
              this... but a feature such as this would be a first of its kind
              and would result in a content experience like no other.

            discovering new music based on their tastes. 
            2. The current algorithm
            limits users, preventing them from stepping outside their usual
            music bubble. 
            
            User Pain Points: 
            
            A common frustration is the
            algorithm’s tendency to recycle songs or deliver unsatisfactory
            recommendations. Many disliked the changes to how songs are added
            to the "Liked Songs" playlist, feeling it adds unnecessary steps.
            One interviewee voiced strong disapproval of Spotify's pre-curated
            playlists, which often duplicate existing music, preferring
            user-generated playlists instead. 
            
            Engagement: 
            Features like
            Spotify Wrapped and other engagement tools were viewed positively,
            enhancing the overall user experience. Interviewees expressed a
            desire for more human input in music recommendations, favoring
            personal curation, like playlists from friends, over algorithmic
            suggestions. 
            
            New Music vs. Variety:
            The algorithm tends to
            prioritize new music within the user’s current tastes, rather than
            offering diverse recommendations based on their past listening. *
            Users feel they aren't being introduced to truly new music, even
            though the suggestions align with their preferences. * There is also
            a desire for variety across genres, not just new tracks within a
            specific genre. * While some users appreciate personalized playlists
            like the Daily Mix or Discover Weekly, others reject them entirely.
            * Most users find algorithms useful for discovering new music,
            though success rates vary, and many prefer to discover music outside
            the platform, such as in social settings or through friends. Smart
            Shuffle Smart Shuffle is a microcosm for how Spotify recommends
            music. As a brief experiment, interviewees were asked to choose a
            random playlist that they had created, then press play with smart
            shuffle enabled. Interviewees were then asked to consider the first
            11 songs added by smart shuffle. How many unique artists are there?
            How many of the artists do you know? Of the 11 added songs, how many
            do you know? This was the results from this test: Interviewee 1:
            Interviewee 2: 11 songs made by 5 artists. 11 songs made by 6
            artists. They knew 8 of 11 songs. They knew 6 of 11 songs. They knew
            4 of 5 artists.  They knew 6 of 6 artists.  Interviewee 3: 11 songs
            made by 9 artists. They knew 8 of 11 songs. They knew 6 of 9
            artists. Problem: Spotify’s recommendations seem to fall between two
            primary parameters: relevance (vibe, genre, artist) and familiarity.
            All interviewees have different music habits, but they are
            recommended music that is mostly familiar, at similar rates. This
            means that Spotify tends to emphasize music users already know,
            recommending less entirely “new” or “different” music. While this
            isn't inherently bad, as users may prefer the comfort of familiar
            music, it creates a potential issue: the algorithm often traps users
            in a feedback loop. They may not even realize they’re stuck or know
            how to break free and discover fresh, exciting music. New
            Assumption: Because Spotify effectively delivers music users like,
            many users are less inclined to actively search for new music.
            Instead, they rely on the platform’s recommendations, which
            reinforces the feedback loop and keeps them within their musical
            ecosystem. Design Solution: Manage Algorithm Design Statement:
            Enhance Spotify's music discovery features by addressing
            frustrations with the algorithm's narrow focus. Improve the balance
            between personalized recommendations and exposure to new, diverse
            music. This can be achieved by refining Spotify’s algorithms,
            adjusting features, and promoting more community-driven content,
            ultimately improving user satisfaction. Design Principles and
            Recommendations: * Encourage Discovery: Offer more variety in
            recommendations. One of the best feelings when discovering new music
            is thinking, "I never thought I’d like this," which stems from
            novelty. The algorithm should strive to provide this type of
            experience. * Manage Algorithm Setting: Develop a new setting that
            allows users to customize the scope of their recommendations,
            enabling them to tailor their music feed to suit their preferences.
            Design: The "Manage Algorithm" setting should align with the rest of
            Spotify’s settings, keeping the interface simple and intuitive.
            Given the concept's complexity, the design must make it easy for
            users to understand and use. A visualizer will be essential to
            provide immediate feedback beyond just percentages. I propose a
            pill-shaped interface with three components: two orbs (green and
            purple) and an outline. 1. Green Orb (Newness): This controls how
            much new music a listener will hear. It adjusts the percentage of
            new songs versus familiar ones, particularly in situations like
            radio play or smart shuffle. The more the user moves the orb toward
            "newness," the more unfamiliar music they'll hear. 2. Purple Orb
            (Variety): This controls the variety of music a listener will hear.
            Spotify's current algorithm tends to restrict recommendations to
            genres that fit the user’s taste profile, leaving out genres they
            may also enjoy. The Variety parameter would allow users to expand
            (or narrow) their musical diet by adding or subtracting genres. 3.
            Proximity: This parameter controls how close the recommendations
            stay to a user’s taste profile. Think of it as casting a net, but
            with adjustable size. The Proximity setting determines how far the
            algorithm will reach into different musical territories to provide
            suggestions, allowing users to explore music outside their usual
            preferences. By integrating these three components, the “Manage
            Algorithm” feature empowers users to take control of their music
            discovery experience and break free from repetitive recommendations.
