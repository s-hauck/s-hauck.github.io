            Problem: Spotify often gives users exactly what they want—sometimes
            to a fault. The current algorithm primarily focuses on replaying
            music users already know and like, rather than introducing them to
            new music from genres they enjoy but don’t explore often. This
            prevents users from discovering fresh tracks within their broader
            tastes. In interviews, users expressed dissatisfaction with
            Spotify's recommendations.

          </figure>
          <p>
            While they appreciate the way the algorithm curates content that
            maintains a certain vibe, they desire more variety beyond their
            usual preferences. Outcome: One of the key design suggestions is the
            introduction of a “Manage Algorithm” setting. This feature would
            allow users to customize the scope of recommendations Spotify
            provides, giving them more control over their listening experience.

            The goal is to offer users the ability to adjust the algorithm’s
            reach, letting them explore music from genres they like but may not
            actively seek out. Primary Feature: The “Manage Algorithm” setting
            would work with three parameters: Newness, Variety, and Proximity.
            (These labels should be user-tested to ensure they are clear and
            intuitive.) Discover: Interviews Conducted: Three Spotify users were
            interviewed. Key Assumptions: * Users want to store their favorite
            artists in one place while discovering new music based on their
            tastes. * The current algorithm limits users, preventing them from
            stepping outside their usual music bubble. User Pain Points: * A
            common frustration is the algorithm’s tendency to recycle songs or
            deliver unsatisfactory recommendations.

          <p>
            * Many disliked the changes to how songs are added to the "Liked
            Songs" playlist, feeling it added unnecessary steps. * One
            interviewee voiced strong disapproval of Spotify's pre-curated
            playlists, which often duplicate existing music, preferring
            user-generated playlists instead. Engagement: * Features like
            Spotify Wrapped and other engagement tools were viewed positively,
            enhancing the overall user experience. * Interviewees expressed a
            desire for more human input in music recommendations, favoring
            personal curation, like playlists from friends, over algorithmic
            suggestions. New Music vs. Variety: * The algorithm tends to
            prioritize new music within the user’s current tastes, rather than
            offering diverse recommendations based on their past listening. *
            Users feel they aren't being introduced to truly new music, even
            though the suggestions align with their preferences. * There is also
            a desire for variety across genres, not just new tracks within a
            specific genre. * While some users appreciate personalized playlists
            like the Daily Mix or Discover Weekly, others reject them entirely.
            * Most users find algorithms useful for discovering new music,
            though success rates vary, and many prefer to discover music outside
            the platform, such as in social settings or through friends. Smart
            Shuffle Smart Shuffle is a microcosm for how Spotify recommends
            music. As a brief experiment, interviewees were asked to choose a
            random playlist that they had created, then press play with smart
            shuffle enabled. Interviewees were then asked to consider the first
            11 songs added by smart shuffle.
          </p>
          <p>
            How many unique artists are there? How many of the artists do you
            know? Of the 11 added songs, how many do you know? This was the
            results from this test: Interviewee 1: Interviewee 2: 11 songs made
            by 5 artists. 11 songs made by 6 artists. They knew 8 of 11 songs.
            They knew 6 of 11 songs. They knew 4 of 5 artists.  They knew 6 of 6
            artists.  Interviewee 3: 11 songs made by 9 artists. They knew 8 of
            11 songs. They knew 6 of 9 artists. Problem: Spotify’s
            recommendations seem to fall between two primary parameters:
            relevance (vibe, genre, artist) and familiarity. All interviewees
            have different music habits, but they are recommended music that is
            mostly familiar, at similar rates. This means that Spotify tends to
            emphasize music users already know, recommending less entirely “new”
            or “different” music. While this isn't inherently bad, as users may
            prefer the comfort of familiar music, it creates a potential issue:
            the algorithm often traps users in a feedback loop. They may not
            even realize they’re stuck or know how to break free and discover
            fresh, exciting music. New Assumption: Because Spotify effectively
            delivers music users like, many users are less inclined to actively
            search for new music. Instead, they rely on the platform’s
            recommendations, which reinforces the feedback loop and keeps them
            within their musical ecosystem. Design Solution: Manage Algorithm
            Design Statement: Enhance Spotify's music discovery features by
            addressing frustrations with the algorithm's narrow focus. Improve
            the balance between personalized recommendations and exposure to
            new, diverse music. This can be achieved by refining Spotify’s
            algorithms, adjusting features, and promoting more community-driven
            content, ultimately improving user satisfaction. Design Principles
            and Recommendations: * Encourage Discovery: Offer more variety in
            recommendations. One of the best feelings when discovering new music
            is thinking, "I never thought I’d like this," which stems from
            novelty. The algorithm should strive to provide this type of
            experience. * Manage Algorithm Setting: Develop a new setting that
            allows users to customize the scope of their recommendations,
            enabling them to tailor their music feed to suit their preferences.
            Design: The "Manage Algorithm" setting should align with the rest of
            Spotify’s settings, keeping the interface simple and intuitive.
            Given the concept's complexity, the design must make it easy for
            users to understand and use. A visualizer will be essential to
            provide immediate feedback beyond just percentages. I propose a
            pill-shaped interface with three components: two orbs (green and
            purple) and an outline. 1. Green Orb (Newness): This controls how
            much new music a listener will hear. It adjusts the percentage of
            new songs versus familiar ones, particularly in situations like
            radio play or smart shuffle. The more the user moves the orb toward
            "newness," the more unfamiliar music they'll hear. 2. Purple Orb
            (Variety): This controls the variety of music a listener will hear.
            Spotify's current algorithm tends to restrict recommendations to
            genres that fit the user’s taste profile, leaving out genres they
            may also enjoy. The Variety parameter would allow users to expand
            (or narrow) their musical diet by adding or subtracting genres. 3.
            Proximity: This parameter controls how close the recommendations
            stay to a user’s taste profile. Think of it as casting a net, but
            with adjustable size. The Proximity setting determines how far the
            algorithm will reach into different musical territories to provide
            suggestions, allowing users to explore music outside their usual
            preferences. By integrating these three components, the “Manage
            Algorithm” feature empowers users to take control of their music
            discovery experience and break free from repetitive recommendations.
