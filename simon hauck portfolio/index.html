            Simon’s goal is to reduce user frustration through thoughtful
            design. He believes that products should be enjoyable to use, and
            provide joy to those who interact with them.

            Guided by curiosity, experimentation, and a commitment to continuous
            learning, Simon approaches design with both a practical mindset and
            an urge to discover.
